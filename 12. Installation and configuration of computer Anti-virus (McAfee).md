2. **Set Up a Schedule**:

#### **D. Configuring the Firewall**
1. **Access Firewall Settings**:
   - Go to **Web and Email Protection** > **Firewall** in the McAfee dashboard.

#### **E. Setting Up Alerts and Notifications**

   - Configure how and when you want to receive alerts, such as for blocked connections, updates, or detected threats.

#### **F. Configuring Anti-Spam and Parental Controls (Optional)**
1. **Anti-Spam**:
   - Go to **Web and Email Protection** > **Anti-Spam**.
   - Configure settings to filter unwanted emails and block spam.

2. **Parental Controls**:
   - In **Parental Controls**, set up rules for safe browsing and restrict access to inappropriate content based on the age of the user.

### **4. Running Your First Full Scan**
1. **Initiate a Full Scan**:
   - After installation and configuration, run a full scan to ensure that your system is free of threats. This may take some time, depending on the size of your hard drive.

2. **Review Scan Results**:
   - Once the scan is complete, review the results and take recommended actions on detected threats.

### **5. Regular Maintenance**
- **Keep McAfee Updated**: Ensure that automatic updates are enabled for both the antivirus definitions and the software itself.
- **Monitor System Performance**: Adjust settings if McAfee slows down your computer, such as excluding certain files or folders from real-time scanning.
- **Perform Regular Scans**: Even with real-time protection, it's a good idea to run regular full or custom scans to catch anything that may have slipped through.

By following these steps, you can ensure that McAfee antivirus is properly installed and configured on your computer, providing robust protection against malware and other online threats.
